In January, 2018 I organized a Christmas tree collection event in my neighbourhood. With the team of volunteers we arranged music, funny contests and snacks for the people who brought their Xmas trees for recycling.
The trees were shredded, the woodchip was sent to animal shelters in St. Petersburg region. It turns out, bison and bears love sleeping on soft sawdust and chewing the fragrant chip.

We collected 2 big trucks of trees and had a lot of fun. I love such events not only for their ecological impact, but also because they help to build a local community. It is always important to bring people together - especially these cold winter days.
