Pictures from my journey to Tanzania and Zanzibar in January 2019.
My camera broke during the safary in the very beginning of the trip - probably because of heat and moist. Huge thanks to [Robin Batista](https://www.robinbatista.com/){:target="\_blank"} for landing me his old Canon, which captured most of this beauty!

A also made a little video here:
