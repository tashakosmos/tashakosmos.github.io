### awesome trip around Estonian lighthouses

In April 2016 [Bikes&Lights project](http://2girls2bikes.com){:target="\_blank"} was born.

That is - 2 girls on bicycles, 2 professional filmmakers, 1 car and 12 Estonian lighthouses. We slept in a terrible place with mice and in a luxury hotel, froze on windy capes and got sunburned on sandy islands, had a fantastic time and wrote [a whole new blog](http://2girls2bikes.com){:target="\_blank"} about it.
In the blog you will fing a detailed story about every day of our travel and a route which you can use if you ever want to do the same trip. But I can’t help but post our travel videos here!

Shooting a travel video with two professional filmmakers is quite a story. Forget that you are tired, cold, hungry and late – just ride your bike in front of the camera on the same spot again and again, turn your head the right way, wait till the cloud is gone, repeat and keep smiling. I had no idea it would be such a serious job – but also that it would be such an interesting experience! And of course the result is totally worth it, check it out:

There are also two mini-novels about lighthouses from this trip.

Part 1:
“There are no identical lighthouses in the world. They are all different. They have different color, heights, parameters. We are all equal in their sight. During this journey I realized that for me lighthouse is a symbol of care. 200 years have passed. We have GPS, new iPhone every month, but Fresnel lens has been intensifying light all this time and nothing can change it. There aren’t many things in our lives that do not change, that you can rely upon. So while there are Fresnel Lenses in lighthouses I’ll be doing just great”.

Part 2:
“You gotta really want to travel. Some people say: I want to go to space, I want to travel by bike, I want to learn to fly a plane… Most of the people have a dream they can bring to life in a week, but they make it a dream of a lifetime. I don’t want to be such a person. My dreams come to life right here right now.”
